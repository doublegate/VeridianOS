# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## 🔒 RULE #1 - ALWAYS CHECK AND READ BEFORE WRITING
**CRITICAL**: ALWAYS check for existence and read from existing files BEFORE attempting to update or write to them. This prevents file corruption, data loss, and wasted time.

**Implementation Protocol**:
1. **Check Existence**: Use `Read`, `Glob`, or `LS` tools to verify file exists
2. **Read Current Content**: Always read the existing file content first
3. **Analyze Structure**: Understand current format, sections, and organization
4. **Plan Changes**: Determine what needs to be modified, added, or updated
5. **Execute Update**: Use `Edit` or `MultiEdit` for modifications, or `Write` only after reading

**Tools Usage Priority**:
- ✅ **ALWAYS**: `Read` → `Edit`/`MultiEdit` (for existing files)
- ✅ **CONDITIONAL**: `Read` → `Write` (only if complete rewrite needed after reading)
- ❌ **NEVER**: Direct `Write` without prior `Read` (unless explicitly creating new file)

## VeridianOS Overview

VeridianOS is a next-generation microkernel operating system written entirely in Rust, emphasizing security, modularity, and formal verification. It uses capability-based security and runs all drivers in user space for maximum isolation.

## Essential Commands

### Building the Kernel
```bash
# Current build commands using standard bare metal targets

## Architecture Overview

### Microkernel Design
- **Core Services Only**: Memory management, scheduling, IPC, and basic hardware abstraction in kernel
- **User-Space Drivers**: All drivers run in isolated user space processes
- **Capability-Based Security**: Every resource access requires an unforgeable capability token
- **Zero-Copy IPC**: Data shared through memory mapping, not copying

### Memory Layout (x86_64)
```
User Space:   0x0000_0000_0000_0000 - 0x0000_7FFF_FFFF_FFFF (128 TB)
Kernel Space: 0xFFFF_8000_0000_0000 - 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF (128 TB)
  - Physical memory mapping: 0xFFFF_8000_0000_0000
  - Kernel heap:            0xFFFF_C000_0000_0000
  - Kernel stacks:          0xFFFF_E000_0000_0000
  - Memory-mapped I/O:      0xFFFF_F000_0000_0000
```

## Key Development Patterns

### Custom Target Configuration
Each architecture requires a custom target JSON file with specific settings:
- Panic strategy: "abort" (no unwinding in kernel)
- Disable red zone for interrupt safety
- Soft float for kernel code
- No standard library dependencies

### Workspace Organization
- Use workspace for managing multiple crates
- Shared dependencies in workspace Cargo.toml
- Profile settings: panic = "abort" for both dev and release

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Colocated with implementation using `#[cfg(test)]`
- **Integration Tests**: In `tests/` directory for each crate
- **System Tests**: QEMU-based testing for full kernel functionality
- **Property Testing**: Use `proptest` for complex invariants

### Security Considerations
- Minimize `unsafe` blocks - formal verification required for any unsafe code
- All system calls go through capability validation
- Hardware security features: Support for Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, ARM CCA
- Post-quantum ready: Designed for ML-KEM and ML-DSA algorithms

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New System Call
1. Define capability requirements in `kernel/src/cap/`
2. Add system call handler in `kernel/src/syscall/`
3. Create user-space wrapper in `userland/libs/libveridian/`
4. Add tests in both kernel and user space

### Creating a New Driver
1. Create new crate in `drivers/` directory
2. Implement driver trait from `drivers/common/`
3. Register with driver manager service
4. Add capability definitions for hardware access

### Debugging Kernel Panics
- Use QEMU with `-s -S` flags for GDB debugging
- Enable verbose logging with `RUST_LOG=trace`
- Check serial output for panic messages
- Use `addr2line` for stack trace analysis
- Run `just debug-<arch>` for automated GDB sessions
- Custom GDB commands available for kernel inspection

### AArch64-Specific Notes
- Iterator-based code causes hangs on bare metal - use direct memory writes only
- Keep boot code extremely simple to avoid issues
- Working implementations preserved in `kernel/src/arch/aarch64/working-simple/`
- UART at 0x09000000 for QEMU virt machine
- Stack at 0x80000 works reliably

## VeridianOS-Specific Development Patterns

### Build System Configuration
- **Current**: Use standard bare metal targets (x86_64-unknown-none, aarch64-unknown-none, riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf)
- **Legacy**: Custom target JSONs in `targets/` directory (preserved but not used)
- **Build Dependencies**: -Zbuild-std automatically handled by .cargo/config.toml
- Workspace structure with kernel as main crate
- Cargo.lock committed for reproducible builds
- Feature flags for conditional compilation:
  - `alloc` feature for heap-dependent code
  - Use `#[cfg(feature = "alloc")]` for optional allocator support
  - Conditional imports: `#[cfg(feature = "alloc")] use alloc::vec::Vec;`
  - Use extern crate alloc when needed

### IPC Development Patterns
- **Message Types**: SmallMessage (≤64 bytes) for fast path, LargeMessage for bulk data
- **Fast Path Design**: Use register-based transfer for <5μs latency
- **Architecture Abstraction**: Separate register mappings for x86_64, AArch64, RISC-V
- **Capability Tokens**: 64-bit format with generation counter for revocation
- **Error Handling**: Use Result<T> with IpcError for all fallible operations
- **Performance Tracking**: CPU timestamp counters for latency measurement
- **Process Integration**: Extension traits for accessing process context
- **Zero-Copy Design**: SharedRegion with page remapping for large transfers
- **Type Aliases**: Use ProcessId = u64 for clarity
- **Result Imports**: Import from error module: `use super::error::Result;`

### Architecture-Specific Details
- **x86_64**: Uses bootloader crate, VGA text output, GDT/IDT setup
- **AArch64**: Custom boot sequence, PL011 UART at 0x09000000, stack at 0x80000
- **RISC-V**: OpenSBI integration, UART at 0x10000000

### CI/CD Configuration
- GitHub Actions with job consolidation for efficiency
- Caching of cargo registry and target directories
- Security audit with rustsec/audit-check action
- RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" for strict checking

### Development Workflow in Distrobox
- Working directory: `/var/home/parobek/Code/VeridianOS`
- User memory location: `/home/parobek/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global user memory)
