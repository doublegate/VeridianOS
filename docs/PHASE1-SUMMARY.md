## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Files Structure
- **Memory**: `kernel/src/mm/` (frame allocator, VMM, heap, VAS)
- **IPC**: `kernel/src/ipc/` (channels, registry, messages, shared memory)
- **Process**: `kernel/src/process/` (PCB, threads, lifecycle, sync)
- **Scheduler**: `kernel/src/sched/` (algorithms, SMP, load balancing)
- **Capabilities**: `kernel/src/cap/` (tokens, delegation, revocation)

### Architecture Support
- **x86_64**: Full implementation with syscall/sysret
- **AArch64**: Complete with EL1/EL0 transitions
- **RISC-V**: SBI integration, S-mode/U-mode support

### Critical Fixes During Implementation
- Bootstrap module resolving circular dependencies
- Atomic operations replacing unsafe statics
- User pointer validation with page table walking
- RAII patterns for comprehensive resource cleanup
- Custom test framework bypassing lang_items conflicts

## Foundation for Phase 2

Phase 1 established:
- ✅ Complete microkernel with all core services
- ✅ Performance targets met or exceeded
- ✅ Zero-warnings policy maintained
- ✅ Comprehensive RAII resource management
- ✅ Full capability-based security model

This foundation enables Phase 2 user space development with:
- Process creation and management APIs
- IPC communication channels
- Memory allocation and protection
- Security through capabilities
- Multi-core scheduling support
