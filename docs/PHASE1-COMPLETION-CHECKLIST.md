# Phase 1 Completion Checklist

## Overview

This document tracks the specific tasks required to complete Phase 1 (Microkernel Core). Phase 1 establishes the fundamental OS services: memory management, process management, IPC, and capability-based security.

**Current Status**: ~35% Complete  
**Started**: June 8, 2025  
**Target Completion**: November 2025 (6 months)  
**Last Updated**: June 9, 2025  
**Critical Path**: Memory Management → Process Management → IPC → Capabilities

## Technical Tasks

### 1. Memory Management (~95% Complete)

**Why Critical**: Foundation for all other kernel services. Without memory management, we cannot allocate process structures, IPC buffers, or capability tables.

- [x] **Frame Allocator Implementation**
  ```rust
  // kernel/src/mm/frame_allocator.rs
  pub struct FrameAllocator {
      bitmap_allocators: [Option<BitmapAllocator>; MAX_NUMA_NODES],
      buddy_allocators: [Option<BuddyAllocator>; MAX_NUMA_NODES],
      stats: Mutex<FrameAllocatorStats>,
  }
  ```
  - [x] Bitmap allocator for small allocations (<512 frames)
  - [x] Buddy allocator for large allocations (≥512 frames)
  - [x] NUMA-aware allocation support
  - [x] Performance statistics tracking

- [x] **Virtual Memory Manager**
  - [x] Page table management (x86_64 4-level, AArch64 4-level, RISC-V Sv48)
  - [x] TLB management and shootdown
  - [x] Virtual address space layout
  - [x] Memory mapping API
  
- [x] **Kernel Heap Allocator**
  - [x] Slab allocator for kernel objects
  - [x] Cache-aware allocation
  - [x] Memory pool management
  - [x] Allocation debugging support

- [x] **Memory Zones**
  - [x] DMA zone (0-16MB)
  - [x] Normal zone (16MB - end)
  - [x] High memory support (32-bit)
  - [x] Zone balancing

### 2. Process Management (0% Complete)

**Why Critical**: Processes are the unit of isolation and resource management. Required for IPC and capabilities.

- [ ] **Process Control Block (PCB)**
  ```rust
  // kernel/src/process/pcb.rs
  pub struct Process {
      pid: ProcessId,
      state: ProcessState,
      memory_map: VirtualAddressSpace,
      capabilities: CapabilityTable,
      threads: Vec<ThreadId>,
      ipc_endpoints: BTreeMap<EndpointId, IpcEndpoint>,
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Process Lifecycle**
  - [ ] Process creation (fork/spawn)
  - [ ] Process termination and cleanup
  - [ ] Process state transitions
  - [ ] Parent-child relationships

- [ ] **Thread Management**
  - [ ] Thread creation and destruction
  - [ ] Thread context structure
  - [ ] Thread-local storage
  - [ ] Thread synchronization primitives

- [ ] **Context Switching**
  - [ ] Architecture-specific context save/restore
  - [ ] FPU/SIMD state management
  - [ ] Performance optimization (<10μs target)

### 3. Inter-Process Communication (~45% Complete)

**Why Critical**: Core microkernel service. All user-space services communicate via IPC.

- [x] **Message Passing Infrastructure**
  - [x] Synchronous channels with ring buffers
  - [x] Asynchronous channels with lock-free implementation
  - [x] Small messages (≤64 bytes) via registers
  - [x] Large messages via shared memory

- [x] **Zero-Copy Transfers**
  - [x] Shared memory regions
  - [x] Page remapping infrastructure
  - [x] NUMA-aware allocation
  - [x] Transfer modes (Move, Share, Copy-on-write)

- [x] **Performance Optimization**
  - [x] Fast path for small messages (<5μs)
  - [x] O(1) endpoint lookup
  - [x] CPU timestamp tracking
  - [x] Rate limiting for DoS protection

- [ ] **IPC Integration**
  - [ ] Process blocking/waking
  - [ ] Scheduler integration
  - [ ] Capability enforcement
  - [ ] Error propagation

### 4. Capability System (0% Complete)

**Why Critical**: Security foundation. Every resource access must be mediated by capabilities.

- [ ] **Capability Implementation**
  ```rust
  // kernel/src/capability/token.rs
  pub struct Capability {
      id: CapabilityId,          // 64-bit unique ID
      target: ResourceId,        // What this grants access to
      permissions: Permissions,  // What operations are allowed
      generation: u16,          // For revocation
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Capability Operations**
  - [ ] Creation and derivation
  - [ ] Validation (O(1) target)
  - [ ] Revocation mechanism
  - [ ] Transfer between processes

- [ ] **Resource Integration**
  - [ ] Memory capabilities
  - [ ] IPC endpoint capabilities

  - [ ] Priority levels (at least 3)
  - [ ] Multi-core support
  - [ ] Load balancing

- [ ] **Scheduling Operations**
  - [ ] yield() system call
