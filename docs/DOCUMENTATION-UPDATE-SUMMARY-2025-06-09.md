## Progress Details

### IPC System (~45% Complete)
âœ… Completed:
- Synchronous message passing with ring buffers
- Asynchronous channels with lock-free buffers
- Fast path IPC (<1Î¼s latency achieved)
- Zero-copy shared memory infrastructure
- Capability system integration (64-bit tokens)
- System call interface for all IPC operations
- Global channel registry with O(1) lookup
- Performance tracking infrastructure
- Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
- IPC tests and benchmarks restored

ðŸ”² Remaining:
- Full integration with scheduler
- Integration tests with full system

### Memory Management (~20% Complete)
âœ… Completed:
