## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Core Design Principles

1. **Microkernel Architecture**
   - Kernel size target: < 15,000 lines of code

2. **Capability-Based Security**
   - 64-bit unforgeable tokens
   - Fine-grained resource access control
   - Hierarchical capability delegation

3. **Zero-Copy IPC**
   - Fast path for small messages (< 64 bytes)

   ```rust
   // Target: < 5μs latency
   pub enum IpcMessage {
       Small([u8; 64]),      // Fast path
       Large(Vec<u8>),       // Shared memory
   }
   ```
