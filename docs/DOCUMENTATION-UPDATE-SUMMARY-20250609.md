# Documentation Update Summary - January 9, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive documentation update performed on January 9, 2025, to reflect the current state of VeridianOS development.

## Key Updates

### 1. Progress Metrics Standardization
- **Phase 0**: 100% Complete (Released as v0.1.0 on June 7, 2025)

  - IPC System: ~45% complete
  - Memory Management: ~20% complete
  - Process Management: Not started
  - Capability System: Not started

### 2. IPC System Progress Details
Completed components (~45%):
- âœ… Synchronous channels with ring buffers
- âœ… Message types (SmallMessage â‰¤64 bytes, LargeMessage)
- âœ… Fast path IPC with register-based transfer (<1Î¼s achieved)
- âœ… Zero-copy shared memory infrastructure
- âœ… Capability system with 64-bit tokens
- âœ… System call interface for all IPC operations
- âœ… Global channel registry with O(1) lookup
- âœ… Error handling framework
- âœ… Process integration hooks
- âœ… Asynchronous channels with lock-free buffers
- âœ… Performance tracking infrastructure
- âœ… Rate limiting for DoS protection

Pending:
- ðŸ”² Integration tests (need scheduler)
- ðŸ”² Actual context switching (needs scheduler)

### 3. Memory Management Progress Details
Completed components (~20%):
- âœ… Hybrid frame allocator (bitmap + buddy system)
- âœ… NUMA-aware allocation support
- âœ… Performance statistics tracking

Pending:
- ðŸ”² Virtual memory manager
- ðŸ”² Kernel heap allocator
- ðŸ”² Memory zones (DMA, Normal, High)
- ðŸ”² Page table management
- ðŸ”² Memory protection mechanisms

### 5. Technical Highlights

#### IPC Enhancements (Latest)
- Global IPC registry with O(1) endpoint/channel lookup
- Asynchronous channels with lock-free ring buffers
- Performance measurement achieving <1Î¼s latency for small messages
- Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm for DoS protection

#### Memory Management Implementation
- Hybrid allocator using bitmap for small allocations (<512 frames)
- Buddy allocator for large allocations (â‰¥512 frames)
- NUMA-aware allocation with per-node allocators
- Comprehensive statistics tracking

### 6. Next Steps
As documented in Phase 1 planning:
1. Complete virtual memory manager implementation
2. Implement kernel heap allocator
3. Begin process management implementation
4. Start capability system design and implementation

## Documentation Standards Applied
- Consistent date format (January 9, 2025)
- Standardized progress percentages
- Clear completed (âœ…) vs pending (ðŸ”²) task marking
- Detailed technical specifications maintained
- Version consistency (v0.1.0) across all documents

## mdBook Status
- Successfully rebuilt with all updates
- Available in `docs/book/book/` directory
- Ready for GitHub Pages deployment via CI/CD

This comprehensive update ensures all documentation accurately reflects the current state of VeridianOS development as of January 9, 2025.
