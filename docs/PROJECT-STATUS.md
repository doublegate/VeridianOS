# VeridianOS Project Status

## Current Status: Phase 0 Implementation In Progress

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-06

As of today, VeridianOS has completed its comprehensive documentation phase and established full project infrastructure. The project has successfully begun Phase 0 implementation with ~50% completion. A significant milestone has been achieved: **the CI/CD pipeline is now 100% passing all checks** after resolving formatting and clippy warnings. The basic kernel structure is in place for all three target architectures.

### Latest Progress
- ✅ QEMU testing infrastructure fully operational
- ✅ Kernel successfully boots on x86_64 and RISC-V architectures
- ✅ Serial I/O working on x86_64 and RISC-V
- 🔄 Debugging AArch64 boot sequence (assembly works, Rust linkage issue)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Completed)
1. ✅ ~~Set up GitHub repository~~ (Complete)
2. ✅ ~~Create initial project structure~~ (Complete)
3. ✅ ~~Set up development environment~~ (Complete)
4. ✅ ~~Create Cargo workspace configuration~~ (Complete)
5. ✅ ~~Implement custom target specifications~~ (Complete)
6. ✅ ~~Basic kernel boot structure~~ (Complete)
7. ✅ ~~CI/CD pipeline operational~~ (Complete)

### Phase 0 Progress (Weeks 1-12)
1. ✅ Install Rust toolchain and dependencies
2. ✅ Create build system with Just
3. 🚧 Implement minimal boot stub (partial - needs bootloader)
4. ⏳ Establish testing infrastructure
5. ✅ Create initial documentation

### Phase 0 Remaining Tasks
1. ⚠️ Complete bootloader integration (x86_64 ✅, RISC-V ✅, AArch64 🔄)
2. ✅ Create linker scripts (all architectures complete)
3. 🔴 Set up GDB debugging infrastructure
4. 🔴 Implement basic memory initialization
5. ✅ Get kernel booting in QEMU with output (x86_64 ✅, RISC-V ✅, AArch64 partial)

### Key Decisions Needed
1. **Hosting**: ✅ GitHub selected (https://github.com/doublegate/VeridianOS)
2. **Communication**: Set up development channels (Discord/Slack/IRC)
3. **Issue Tracking**: ✅ GitHub Issues + comprehensive TODO system
4. **Release Cycle**: ✅ Semantic versioning defined in documentation

## Project Metrics

### Documentation Statistics
- **Total Documents**: 25+ comprehensive guides
- **Lines of Documentation**: ~20,000+
- **Code Examples**: 200+ Rust code snippets
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Detailed system layouts
- **TODO Items**: 1000+ tasks tracked across phases

### Planned Implementation Metrics
- **Target Languages**: 100% Rust (no C/assembly except boot)
- **Supported Architectures**: x86_64, AArch64, RISC-V
- **Estimated SLOC**: 500,000+ lines
- **Test Coverage Goal**: >90% for core components

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **Complexity**: Microkernel design is inherently complex
   - *Mitigation*: Incremental development, extensive testing

2. **Performance**: Potential overhead from security features
   - *Mitigation*: Optimization phase, profiling tools

3. **Hardware Support**: Limited driver availability initially
   - *Mitigation*: Focus on common hardware, community contributions

### Project Risks
1. **Timeline**: 42-month timeline is ambitious
   - *Mitigation*: Phased approach allows partial releases

2. **Resources**: Requires sustained development effort
   - *Mitigation*: Open source community involvement

3. **Adoption**: New OS faces adoption challenges
   - *Mitigation*: Focus on specific use cases, compatibility layers
