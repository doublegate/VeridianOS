**Last Updated**: 2025-06-10  
**Current Version**: v0.1.0 (Released June 7, 2025)  
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Microkernel Core (Started June 8, 2025)  
**Phase 1 Progress**: ~35% overall (IPC ~45%, Memory Management ~95%, Process Management 100%)

VeridianOS has successfully completed Phase 0 (Foundation and Tooling) and released v0.1.0! The project is now actively developing the microkernel core with significant progress on IPC, Memory Management, and Process Management.
