## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

### Architecture Choices
1. **Hybrid Memory Allocator**: Combines best of bitmap (simplicity) and buddy (efficiency)
2. **Lock-Free IPC**: Asynchronous channels use lock-free algorithms for scalability
3. **Register-Based Fast Path**: Leverages architecture-specific registers for speed
4. **NUMA-Aware Design**: Built-in from the start, not retrofitted

### Security Decisions
1. **Capability Tokens**: 64-bit unforgeable tokens with generation counters
2. **Zero-Copy Controls**: Explicit permission model for shared memory
3. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in DoS protection at IPC layer
4. **Process Isolation**: Strict separation enforced by design

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

1. **IPC Module Structure**: Refactored for better test accessibility
2. **Feature Flag Management**: Proper gating of alloc-dependent code
3. **Cross-Architecture Support**: Unified approach to platform differences
4. **Performance Measurement**: Accurate cycle counting across architectures
5. **AArch64 FpuState**: Fixed struct definition for proper compilation
6. **RISC-V Build Issues**: Resolved architecture-specific type conflicts
7. **Context Switching**: Unified trait implementation across all architectures

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **Early Integration Testing**: IPC tests revealed design issues early
2. **Performance First**: Benchmarking during development, not after
3. **Modular Design**: Clean interfaces between subsystems pay off
4. **Feature Flags**: Essential for no_std/alloc compatibility

### Process Improvements
1. **Incremental Implementation**: Small, testable chunks work better
2. **Documentation Driven**: Writing docs first clarifies design
