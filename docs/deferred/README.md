# Deferred Implementation Items Documentation

This directory contains organized documentation of all deferred implementation items for VeridianOS, broken down by category and priority. These files track TODOs, incomplete features, and future enhancements identified during development.

## File Organization

### 00-INDEX.md
**Purpose**: Master index and overview of all deferred items
- Quick reference guide to all categories
- Priority legend and phase mapping
- Links to specific category files

### 01-CRITICAL-ARCHITECTURE-ISSUES.md
**Priority**: 游댮 CRITICAL - Development blockers
**Purpose**: Documents critical issues that prevent proper kernel operation
- AArch64 iterator/loop bug (major blocker)
- Context switching implementation gaps
- Kernel entry point issues
- Architecture-specific initialization problems

### 02-CORE-KERNEL-SYSTEMS.md
**Priority**: 游리 HIGH - Core functionality
**Purpose**: Tracks incomplete core kernel subsystems
- Process and thread management gaps
- Memory management integration issues
- Scheduler implementation needs
- System call interface completion

### 03-MEMORY-MANAGEMENT.md
**Priority**: 游리 HIGH - Essential for stability
**Purpose**: Documents memory subsystem improvements needed
- Virtual memory operations
- User-kernel memory safety
- Page fault handling
- Physical memory management enhancements

### 04-IPC-CAPABILITY-SYSTEM.md
**Priority**: 游리 MEDIUM - Security and communication
**Purpose**: Tracks IPC and capability system completion
- IPC system call implementation
- Process blocking and synchronization
- Capability space management
- Security policy enforcement

### 05-BUILD-TEST-INFRASTRUCTURE.md
**Priority**: 游리 MEDIUM - Development efficiency
**Purpose**: Documents build system and testing issues
- Test framework limitations (lang items conflict)
- Build system warnings and improvements
- CI/CD enhancements
- Documentation generation

### 06-CODE-QUALITY-CLEANUP.md
**Priority**: 游릳 LOW - Maintainability
**Purpose**: Tracks code quality improvements
- Magic number elimination
- Error handling standardization
- Unsafe code audit
- Performance optimizations

### 07-FUTURE-FEATURES.md
**Priority**: 游릳 LOW - Long-term roadmap
**Purpose**: Documents planned features for future phases
- Phase 2 prerequisites (init, shell, VFS)
- Phase 3+ features (security, networking, GUI)
- Research and experimental features
- Hardware support expansion

### IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
**Purpose**: Strategic roadmap for addressing all deferred items
- 5 milestone breakdown over 40-52 weeks
- Priority-ordered implementation strategy
- Dependencies and risk analysis
- Resource requirements and success metrics

## Priority Levels

- 游댮 **CRITICAL**: Blocking issues preventing development
- 游리 **HIGH**: Core functionality required for basic operation
- 游리 **MEDIUM**: Important features for production readiness
- 游릳 **LOW**: Nice-to-have features and optimizations

## Usage

1. **For Developers**: Start with IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md for the roadmap, then dive into specific category files based on current work
2. **For Bug Fixes**: Check 01-CRITICAL-ARCHITECTURE-ISSUES.md first
3. **For Feature Work**: Review relevant category files for TODOs and missing functionality
4. **For Code Review**: Use 06-CODE-QUALITY-CLEANUP.md to identify improvement areas

## Maintenance

These files should be updated as:
- New issues are discovered during development
- Items are completed and can be marked as resolved
- Priorities shift based on project needs
- New features are planned for future phases
