# Pre-Phase 2 Fixes Summary

**Created**: January 17, 2025  
**Purpose**: Track remaining fixes required before Phase 2 development  
**Current Status**: 9 fixes identified across all architectures

## Executive Summary

Before initiating Phase 2 (User Space Foundation) development, there are 9 remaining fixes that should be addressed. These range from critical blockers to minor improvements. The two most critical issues are:

1. **AArch64 Bootstrap Process** - Currently completely bypassed due to LLVM loop compilation bugs
2. **x86_64 Early Boot Hang** - Prevents any development/testing on x86_64 platform

## Priority Breakdown

### ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY (2 items) - Critical Blockers

#### 1. Complete AArch64 Bootstrap Process
- **Status**: Currently bypassed in main.rs
- **Location**: `kernel/src/main.rs` (lines 172-215)
- **Impact**: No proper subsystem initialization on AArch64
- **Solution**: Rewrite bootstrap using assembly-only methods from direct_uart.rs
- **Effort**: 1-2 weeks

#### 2. Fix x86_64 Early Boot Hang (ISSUE-0012)
- **Status**: Open since June 13, 2025
- **Impact**: Cannot test/develop on x86_64
- **Symptoms**: No serial output, hangs before kernel_main
- **Investigation Needed**: Early boot assembly, serial init timing
- **Effort**: 3-5 days debugging

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY (4 items) - Important Features

#### 3. Kernel Stack in TSS (x86_64)
- **Location**: `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/context.rs`
- **Impact**: Proper interrupt handling
- **Current**: TODO placeholder
- **Effort**: 2-3 days

#### 4. APIC Module (x86_64)
- **Location**: Timer and IPI functionality
- **Current**: Using println! stubs
- **Impact**: No multi-core support, no timer interrupts
- **Effort**: 1 week

#### 5. Thread Local Storage (All Architectures)
- **Location**: context.rs files for each arch
- **Impact**: Cannot store per-thread data
- **Current**: TODO placeholders
- **Effort**: 3-4 days per architecture

#### 6. Test Framework Lang Items Conflict
- **Impact**: Cannot run automated tests
- **Issue**: Fundamental Rust toolchain limitation
- **Workaround**: Manual QEMU testing only
- **Effort**: Investigation needed, may not be fixable

### ðŸŸ¨ LOW PRIORITY (3 items) - Nice to Have

#### 7. RISC-V UART Initialization
- **Location**: `kernel/src/arch/riscv64/serial.rs:87`
- **Current**: Basic functionality works
- **Enhancement**: Proper initialization sequence
- **Effort**: 1 day

#### 8. RISC-V SBI Module Expansion
- **Current**: Minimal implementation
- **Enhancement**: Full SBI interface
- **Impact**: Better hardware abstraction
- **Effort**: 2-3 days

#### 9. Target JSON Updates
- **Issue**: Unused 'rustc-abi' field warnings
- **Impact**: Build warnings only
- **Solution**: Update to current format
- **Effort**: 1 hour

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 2A: Critical Fixes (1-2 weeks)
1. Focus on x86_64 boot hang first (enables faster development)
2. Then tackle AArch64 bootstrap rewrite
3. These two fixes unblock all further development

### Phase 2B: Medium Priority (2-3 weeks)
4. Implement TLS for all architectures (needed for user space)
5. Complete x86_64 TSS kernel stack
6. Implement basic APIC functionality
7. Investigate test framework workarounds

### Phase 2C: Low Priority (1 week)
8. RISC-V enhancements
9. Target JSON cleanup

## Alternative Approach

If the critical fixes prove too time-consuming, consider:

1. **Temporary x86_64 Focus**: Skip x86_64 boot fix, develop exclusively on RISC-V
2. **Minimal AArch64**: Implement just enough bootstrap for basic user space
3. **Deferred Fixes**: Move some medium priority items to Phase 3

## Success Criteria

Before declaring ready for Phase 2:
- [ ] At least one architecture fully functional (preferably RISC-V)
- [ ] Basic bootstrap working on all architectures
- [ ] TLS implemented for primary development architecture
- [ ] Clear plan for addressing remaining issues

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: x86_64 boot hang may be deep hardware issue
- **Medium Risk**: AArch64 LLVM bugs may affect more than loops
- **Low Risk**: Other fixes are straightforward implementation tasks

## Recommendation

Start with RISC-V as the primary development platform for Phase 2, as it has the fewest critical issues. Fix x86_64 and complete AArch64 in parallel while Phase 2 development proceeds on RISC-V.
