# Deferred Implementation Items Index

This directory contains all deferred implementation items organized by category and priority. Items are tracked from various development sessions and phases.

## Organization

Files are numbered by priority:
- **01-** Critical blockers that prevent core functionality
- **02-** High priority items needed for basic OS operation  
- **03-** Important subsystem implementations
- **04-** Secondary features and integrations
- **05-** Development infrastructure
- **06-** Code quality and cleanup
- **07-** Future features and long-term goals
