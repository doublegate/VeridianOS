# Deferred Implementation Items Index

This directory contains all deferred implementation items organized by category and priority. Items are tracked from various development sessions and phases.

## Organization

Files are numbered by priority:
- **01-** Critical blockers that prevent core functionality
- **02-** High priority items needed for basic OS operation  
- **03-** Important subsystem implementations
- **04-** Secondary features and integrations
- **05-** Development infrastructure
- **06-** Code quality and cleanup
- **07-** Future features and long-term goals

- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Completed items (kept for reference)

## Latest Updates

**January 17, 2025 (Latest Review)**: Pre-Phase 2 Assessment
- ‚úÖ AArch64 assembly-only approach successfully bypasses LLVM bugs (v0.2.1)
- ‚úÖ All three architectures boot to Stage 6 successfully  
- ‚úÖ Context switching implemented and working on all architectures
- ‚ö†Ô∏è AArch64 bootstrap process still bypassed - needs loop-free reimplementation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è x86_64 early boot hang (ISSUE-0012) remains unresolved
- üìã 9 remaining fixes identified before Phase 2 (see TODO list)

**June 17, 2025**: v0.2.1 Maintenance Release
- ‚úÖ All three architectures boot to Stage 6 successfully
- ‚úÖ AArch64 assembly-only approach bypasses LLVM bugs  
- ‚úÖ Zero warnings and clippy-clean across all architectures
- ‚úÖ Documentation reorganized (sessions moved to docs/archive/sessions/)
- ‚úÖ Ready for Phase 2 user space development

**June 15, 2025**: Critical Blockers RESOLVED
- ‚úÖ AArch64 iterator bug - Created comprehensive workarounds
- ‚úÖ Context switching - Was already implemented, fixed scheduler integration
- ‚úÖ Unified kernel_main across all architectures
- ‚úÖ All architectures now build with zero warnings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è x86_64 boot hang remains (separate issue)

**June 13, 2025**: DEEP-RECOMMENDATIONS implementation
- Bootstrap improvements
- Error handling enhancements
- Architecture-specific fixes

**June 12, 2025**: Phase 1 completion
- Many items resolved
- Full system integration tested
- v0.2.0 released

## Phase 2 Priority Items (9 Tasks Remaining)

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Must Fix
1. **AArch64 Bootstrap Process** - Currently bypassed, needs loop-free implementation
2. **x86_64 Early Boot Hang** - ISSUE-0012, no serial output on early boot

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Should Fix
3. **Kernel Stack in TSS** - x86_64 TODO placeholder exists
4. **APIC Module** - x86_64 timer/IPI using println! stubs
5. **Thread Local Storage** - TODOs in all architecture context.rs files
6. **Test Framework** - Lang items conflict blocking automated tests

### üü® LOW PRIORITY - Nice to Have
7. **RISC-V UART Init** - TODO at arch/riscv64/serial.rs
8. **RISC-V SBI Module** - Minimal implementation needs expansion
9. **Target JSON Updates** - Unused 'rustc-abi' field warnings
