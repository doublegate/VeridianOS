## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to completing VeridianOS. The critical path focuses on unblocking development (AArch64 issues, context switching) before building core OS features. Each milestone delivers tangible value and moves the system closer to production readiness.

Success depends on:
1. Solving the AArch64 iterator issue quickly
2. Maintaining code quality throughout
3. Comprehensive testing at each stage
4. Clear communication between team members
5. Flexibility to adjust priorities based on discoveries

With dedicated effort and proper resource allocation, VeridianOS can achieve its goal of being a secure, efficient, and modern microkernel operating system.
