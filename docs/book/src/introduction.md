  <strong>A next-generation microkernel operating system built with Rust</strong>
</p>

## Welcome to VeridianOS

VeridianOS is a modern microkernel operating system written entirely in Rust, emphasizing security, modularity, and performance. This book serves as the comprehensive guide for understanding, building, and contributing to VeridianOS.

## Key Features

- 🛡️ **Capability-based security** - Unforgeable tokens for all resource access
- 🚀 **Microkernel architecture** - Minimal kernel with services in user space
- 🦀 **Written in Rust** - Memory safety without garbage collection
- ⚡ **High performance** - Lock-free algorithms, zero-copy IPC
- 🔧 **Multi-architecture** - x86_64, AArch64, and RISC-V support
- 🔒 **Security focused** - Mandatory access control, secure boot, hardware security
- 📦 **Modern package management** - Source and binary package support
- 🖥️ **Wayland compositor** - Modern display server with GPU acceleration

## Why VeridianOS?

Traditional monolithic kernels face challenges in security, reliability, and maintainability. VeridianOS addresses these challenges through:

1. **Microkernel Design**: Only essential services run in kernel space, minimizing the attack surface
2. **Capability-Based Security**: Fine-grained access control with unforgeable capability tokens
3. **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system prevents entire classes of vulnerabilities
4. **Modern Architecture**: Designed for contemporary hardware with multi-core, NUMA, and heterogeneous computing support

## Project Philosophy

VeridianOS follows these core principles:

- **Security First**: Every design decision prioritizes security
- **Correctness Over Performance**: We optimize only after proving correctness
- **Modularity**: Components are loosely coupled and independently updatable
- **Transparency**: All development happens in the open with clear documentation
