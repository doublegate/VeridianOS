# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The security of VeridianOS is our top priority. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### Do NOT
- Open a public GitHub issue
- Discuss the vulnerability publicly
- Exploit the vulnerability

### Do
1. Email security@veridian-os.org with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes

2. Allow up to 72 hours for initial response

3. Work with us to understand and resolve the issue

## Security Design Principles

VeridianOS is designed with security as a fundamental principle:

### 1. Capability-Based Security
- All resource access requires unforgeable capability tokens
- Fine-grained permission control
- No ambient authority

### 2. Memory Safety
- Written in Rust to prevent memory corruption
- Minimal unsafe code with thorough documentation
- Automatic bounds checking

### 3. Isolation
- Microkernel architecture minimizes trusted code
- User-space drivers and services
- Process isolation with separate address spaces

### 4. Hardware Security Features
- Support for Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, ARM CCA
- Hardware memory tagging (Intel LAM, ARM MTE)
- IOMMU for DMA protection

## Supported Versions

As VeridianOS is in early development, only the latest version receives security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Security Features by Phase

### Phase 0-1 (Current)
- Basic memory protection
- Address space isolation
- Capability system foundation

### Phase 2-3 (Planned)
- Mandatory access control
- Secure boot
- Cryptographic services
- Audit logging

### Phase 4-6 (Future)
- Advanced threat detection
- Hardware security integration
- Formal verification
- Post-quantum cryptography
