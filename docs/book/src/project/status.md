**Latest Release**: v0.1.0 - Foundation & Tooling  
**Released**: June 7, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Microkernel Core (Started June 8, 2025)  
**Phase 1 Progress**: IPC System ~45% complete, Memory Management started

VeridianOS has successfully completed Phase 0 and is now actively developing the microkernel core. The IPC (Inter-Process Communication) system is the current focus, with synchronous message passing, fast path optimization, and zero-copy transfers already implemented.
