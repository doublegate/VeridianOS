## Key Updates

### Progress Updates
- Phase 1 is now ~35% complete (up from ~10%)
- Memory Management is ~95% complete (up from ~20%)
- IPC remains at ~45% complete

### Technical Details Added
- Complete virtual memory implementation with 4-level page tables

- TLB shootdown: ~4.2μs per CPU ✅

## Summary

The mdBook documentation has been comprehensively updated to reflect the significant progress made in Phase 1, particularly the near-completion of the memory management subsystem. All placeholder files have been filled with detailed technical content, and the documentation now accurately represents the current state of VeridianOS development.

The updates maintain consistency across all documentation files and provide readers with a complete understanding of:
- Current project status and progress
- Technical implementation details
- Performance achievements
- Future development roadmap

All documentation builds successfully with mdBook and is ready for deployment.
