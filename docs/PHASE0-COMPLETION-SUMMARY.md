## 📊 Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Lines of Code | ~2,000 |
| Documentation Pages | 25+ |
| CI/CD Jobs | 7 |
| Test Coverage | Foundation laid |
| Architectures Supported | 3 (x86_64, AArch64, RISC-V) |
| Issues Resolved | 7 |
| Open Issues | 0 |

## 🚀 Major Milestones Achieved

1. **All Architectures Booting**: Successfully boots on x86_64, AArch64, and RISC-V
2. **CI/CD 100% Passing**: Fully automated build and test pipeline
3. **GDB Debugging**: Complete debugging infrastructure for all platforms
4. **Documentation Framework**: Comprehensive docs with automated generation
5. **Development Workflow**: Professional git hooks and contribution process

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **AArch64 Boot Complexity**: Iterator-based code causes issues in bare metal AArch64
2. **Custom Targets**: Require careful LLVM configuration and -Zbuild-std flags
3. **No-std Testing**: Requires custom test framework and QEMU integration
4. **Cross-Architecture Support**: Each platform has unique initialization requirements

### Process Improvements
1. **Documentation First**: Comprehensive planning documents proved invaluable
2. **Incremental Progress**: Breaking Phase 0 into smaller milestones helped track progress
3. **CI/CD Early**: Setting up automation early caught issues quickly
4. **Version Control Discipline**: Git hooks and templates improve code quality

## 🔜 Next Steps: Phase 1

With Phase 0 complete, we're ready to begin Phase 1: Microkernel Core implementation.

### Phase 1 Priorities
1. **Memory Management**: Implement frame allocator and virtual memory
2. **Process Management**: Basic process creation and context switching
3. **IPC System**: Message passing and shared memory
4. **Capability System**: Security token implementation
5. **Scheduler**: Basic round-robin scheduling

### Immediate Tasks
1. Review Phase 1 design documents
2. Set up memory allocator framework
3. Implement basic page table management
4. Create process control blocks
5. Design IPC message format

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
