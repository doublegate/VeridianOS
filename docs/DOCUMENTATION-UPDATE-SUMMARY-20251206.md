## Key Technical Updates Documented

### Build System Improvements
- `build-kernel.sh` script automates architecture-specific builds
- x86_64 uses custom target with kernel code model to fix relocation issues
- AArch64 and RISC-V use standard bare metal targets
- Kernel linked at 0xFFFFFFFF80100000 for x86_64 (top 2GB)

### Boot Sequence Fixes
