# Critical Boot Fixes Session - June 15, 2025

## Overview

This document details a comprehensive debugging session that used three parallel worktree approaches to diagnose and fix critical boot issues across all three VeridianOS architectures (x86_64, AArch64, RISC-V). The session resulted in significant progress on resolving context switching and initialization order problems.

## Initial Issues Identified

### 1. Initialization Order Bug (All Architectures)
- Test tasks were being created in `main.rs` before the process subsystem was initialized
- This caused immediate hangs on all architectures when test tasks tried to access uninitialized process structures

### 2. x86_64 Specific Issues
- Infinite loop when loading bootstrap context - kept printing "[SCHED] Loading initial task context for 'bootstrap'" repeatedly
- Scheduler deadlock due to holding lock while trying to load context
- Incorrect assembly offsets in `load_context` function
- Frame allocator underflow bug when tracking consecutive frames

### 3. AArch64 Specific Issues  
- Known LLVM iterator/loop compilation bug causing hangs
- Serial output showing repeated '[' characters due to println! macro issues
- Already had `safe_iter.rs` workarounds but println! macro wasn't using them

### 4. RISC-V Specific Issues
- Hanging at heap initialization: "[HEAP] Initializing kernel heap at 0xffffc00000000000"
- Likely related to static heap array not being properly mapped

## Three-Workflow Analysis Approach

### 1. Conservative Workflow
**Goal**: Minimal, targeted fixes without major refactoring

**Key Findings**:
- Identified scheduler deadlock in `start()` function
- Found that moving test task creation to bootstrap stage 4 fixed initialization order
- Discovered AArch64 serial driver already avoided loops but println! macro was the issue

**Fixes Applied**:
- Dropped scheduler lock before entering loop in `start()`
- Moved test task creation to `bootstrap_stage4()`
- Confirmed AArch64 `write_str` implementation was loop-free

### 2. Refactor Workflow
**Goal**: Comprehensive refactoring for cleaner architecture

**Key Findings**:
- Bootstrap flow could be unified across architectures
- Context switching integration needed better structure
- Memory initialization sequence could be improved

**Fixes Applied**:
- Unified kernel_main entry point across all architectures
- Cleaned up bootstrap task initialization flow
- Better separation of concerns in scheduler start

### 3. Deep-Fix Workflow
**Goal**: Deep technical analysis including assembly examination

**Key Findings**:
- x86_64 `load_context` assembly had wrong struct offsets:
  - CR3 was at offset 160, not 200
  - CS was at offset 144, not 176
  - SS was at offset 146, not 178
- Frame allocator had logic error in consecutive frame tracking
- x86_64 context wasn't initializing CR3 properly

**Fixes Applied**:
- Corrected all assembly offsets based on actual struct layout
- Fixed frame allocator to properly track start of consecutive sequences
- Added CR3 initialization to use current value
- Added CR3 validation in load_context (skip if zero)

## Technical Details of Main Branch Modifications

### 1. Scheduler Deadlock Fix (`kernel/src/sched/mod.rs`)

```rust
// Before: Held lock while trying to load context
pub fn start() -> ! {
    let current_task = {
        let scheduler = SCHEDULER.lock();
        scheduler.current
    };
    if let Some(task_ptr) = current_task {
        // Load context...
    }
}

// After: Drop lock before loop, check inside loop
pub fn start() -> ! {
    {
        let scheduler = SCHEDULER.lock();
        if scheduler.current.is_none() {
            panic!("[SCHED] No current task to run!");
        }
    } // Drop lock here
    
    loop {
        let scheduler = SCHEDULER.lock();
        if let Some(current_task) = &scheduler.current {
            // Load context...
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Context Assembly Fixes (`kernel/src/arch/x86_64/context.rs`)

```rust
// Corrected offsets based on struct layout:
// - General purpose registers: 0-112 (15 * 8 bytes)
// - rsp: 120
// - rip: 128  
// - rflags: 136
// - cs: 144 (u16)
// - ss: 146 (u16)
// - ds: 148 (u16)
// - es: 150 (u16)
// - cr3: 160

// Added CR3 validation and loading:
"mov rax, [rdi + 160]", // cr3
"test rax, rax",
"jz 2f",
"mov cr3, rax",
"2:",

// Fixed segment loading with correct offsets:
"movzx rax, word ptr [rdi + 146]", // SS (zero-extend u16)
"push rax",
"push qword ptr [rdi + 120]", // RSP
"push qword ptr [rdi + 136]", // RFLAGS  
"movzx rax, word ptr [rdi + 144]", // CS (zero-extend u16)
"push rax",
"push qword ptr [rdi + 128]", // RIP
```

### 3. Frame Allocator Fix (`kernel/src/mm/frame_allocator.rs`)

```rust
// Before: Could underflow when consecutive == count and start_bit == 0
for bit in 0..64 {
    if *word & (1 << bit) != 0 {
        consecutive += 1;
        if consecutive == count {
            let first_frame = start_bit - count + 1; // UNDERFLOW!
        }
    } else {
        consecutive = 0;
        start_bit = word_idx * 64 + bit + 1;
    }
}

// After: Track start properly when beginning new sequence
for bit in 0..64 {
    if *word & (1 << bit) != 0 {
        if consecutive == 0 {
            start_bit = word_idx * 64 + bit; // Mark start
        }
        consecutive += 1;
        if consecutive == count {
            let first_frame = start_bit; // No math needed
        }
    } else {
        consecutive = 0;
    }
}
```

### 4. Bootstrap Task Creation (`kernel/src/bootstrap.rs`)

```rust
// Moved from main.rs to bootstrap_stage4 after process init:
pub fn bootstrap_stage4() -> KernelResult<()> {
    // ... IPC and capability init ...
    
    #[cfg(feature = "alloc")]
    {
        println!("[BOOTSTRAP] Creating test tasks for context switch demonstration");
        crate::test_tasks::create_test_tasks();
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### 5. Context Initialization (`kernel/src/arch/x86_64/context.rs`)

```rust
// Initialize CR3 with current value instead of 0:
cr3: unsafe {
    let mut cr3: u64;
    asm!("mov {}, cr3", out(reg) cr3);
    cr3
},
```

## Results After Fixes

### x86_64
- **Progress**: Now successfully loads bootstrap task context
- **Issue**: Context switch appears to return to kernel start (infinite boot loop)
- **Next Steps**: Need to properly set up bootstrap task entry point

## x86_64 Context Switch Fix (Second Session)

### Problem
After the initial fixes, x86_64 was still experiencing an infinite boot loop. The system would load the bootstrap task context but immediately restart from kernel_main instead of executing bootstrap_stage4.

### Root Cause Analysis
Three parallel worktrees investigated different approaches:

1. **Bootstrap Entry Workflow**: Discovered the issue was with using `iretq` instruction
2. **Assembly Debug Workflow**: Proved context switching mechanics were working
3. **Task Creation Workflow**: Explored alternative task entry approaches

The key finding: `iretq` is designed for interrupt returns, not kernel-to-kernel context switches.

### Solution
Changed `load_context` from using `iretq` to `ret` instruction:

```rust
// Before: Using iretq (incorrect for kernel context switch)
unsafe extern "C" fn load_context(context: *const X86_64Context) {
    asm!(
        // ... load registers ...
        "iretq",  // Wrong! This expects interrupt stack frame
        // ...
    );
}

// After: Using ret (correct for kernel context switch)
unsafe extern "C" fn load_context(context: *const X86_64Context) {
    asm!(
        // ... load registers ...
        "mov rsp, [rdi + 120]",
        "push qword ptr [rdi + 128]", // Push RIP as return address
        "ret",  // Jump to pushed address
        // ...
    );
}
```

### Result
✅ **Context switch now works correctly!** Bootstrap_stage4 executes successfully.

### Memory Mapping Issue Resolution (Third Session)

#### Problem
After fixing the context switch, the kernel encountered a new hang when creating the init process. Investigation revealed two memory mapping issues:

1. **Duplicate Kernel Space Mapping**: The VAS `init()` method was calling `map_kernel_space()`, but process creation was calling it again, causing "Address range already mapped" errors.

2. **Excessive Heap Mapping**: The kernel was trying to map 256MB for kernel heap when total system memory was only 128MB, causing frame allocation to hang.

#### Investigation Process
Added debug output to trace execution through:
- Process creation (`create_process_with_options`)
- Virtual Address Space initialization (`VAS::init`)
- Kernel space mapping (`map_kernel_space`)
- Region mapping (`map_region`)

The kernel successfully created the process (PID 1) and page table, but hung during frame allocation for the 256MB heap region (65,536 frames).

#### Solutions Applied

**Fix 1: Remove Duplicate Mapping**
```rust
// Before: Double mapping
{
    let mut memory_space = process.memory_space.lock();
    memory_space.init()?;  // Already calls map_kernel_space()
    memory_space.map_kernel_space()?;  // Duplicate call!
}

// After: Single mapping
{
    let mut memory_space = process.memory_space.lock();
    // init() already maps kernel space, so we don't need to call map_kernel_space() again
    memory_space.init()?;
}
```

**Fix 2: Reduce Heap Mapping Size**
```rust
// Before: Excessive heap mapping
self.map_region(
    VirtualAddress(0xFFFF_C000_0000_0000),
    0x1000_0000, // 256MB for kernel heap - too large!
    MappingType::Heap,
)?;

// After: Reasonable heap mapping
self.map_region(
    VirtualAddress(0xFFFF_C000_0000_0000),
    0x1000000, // 16MB for kernel heap - fits in 128MB total memory
    MappingType::Heap,
)?;
```

#### Result
✅ **Memory mapping now works correctly!** 
- Virtual address space initialization completes successfully
- Kernel space mapping (code, data, heap) works without conflicts
- Init process creation progresses beyond memory setup

#### Files Modified
- `kernel/src/process/lifecycle.rs`: Removed duplicate `map_kernel_space()` call
- `kernel/src/mm/vas.rs`: Reduced kernel heap mapping from 256MB to 16MB

### AArch64  
- **Progress**: Boots and shows output but with '[' character spam
- **Issue**: println! macro uses iterators which trigger LLVM bug
- **Next Steps**: Modify println! macro to use safe_iter utilities

### RISC-V
- **Progress**: Boots through memory initialization
- **Issue**: Still hangs at heap initialization
- **Next Steps**: Investigate if heap virtual address is properly mapped

## Key Learnings

1. **Initialization Order is Critical**: Creating tasks before subsystems are ready causes immediate failures

2. **Assembly Offsets Must Match Exactly**: Even small mismatches in struct offsets cause context switching to fail catastrophically

3. **Compiler Bugs Require Creative Workarounds**: AArch64's iterator bug requires avoiding all loop constructs

4. **Lock Management in Kernel Code**: Must be extremely careful about lock scope to avoid deadlocks

5. **Debugging Benefits from Multiple Approaches**: The three-workflow approach allowed exploring different solutions simultaneously

## Commit Summary

The fixes were committed as:
```
commit 6d2b549
