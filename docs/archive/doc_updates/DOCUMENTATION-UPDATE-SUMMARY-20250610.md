# Documentation Update Summary - June 10, 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive documentation update performed on June 10, 2025, to reflect the current project state.

## Key Updates

### Process Management Status Change
- **Previous Status**: ~90% Complete
- **New Status**: 100% Complete
- **Reason**: All process management features have been implemented, including:
  - Process Control Block (PCB) with comprehensive state management
  - Thread management with full ThreadContext trait implementation
  - Context switching for all architectures (x86_64, AArch64, RISC-V)
  - Process lifecycle management (creation, termination, state transitions)
  - Global process table with O(1) lookup
  - Process synchronization primitives (Mutex, Semaphore, CondVar, RwLock, Barrier)
  - Memory management integration
  - IPC integration hooks
  - Process system calls (create, fork, exec, exit, wait, kill)
  - Architecture-specific context switching fully implemented

### Phase 1 Overall Progress
- **Current Status**: ~35% Complete
- **Components**:
  - IPC System: ~45% complete
  - Memory Management: ~95% complete
  - Process Management: 100% complete (updated from 90%)
  - Capability System: Not started

### Date Updates
- All documentation updated from various dates (January 10, 2025) to current date (June 10, 2025)
- Reflects the actual date of development progress

### Build Status
- All architectures (x86_64, AArch64, RISC-V) build successfully
- Code passes all formatting and linting checks
- 7 unpushed commits ready for review and merge

## Files Updated

### Root Directory
1. `README.md` - Updated process management status to 100%
2. `CHANGELOG.md` - Updated process management status and date
3. `VERSION` - Already at correct version 0.1.0

### Documentation Directory (`docs/`)
1. `PROJECT-STATUS.md` - Updated process management to 100% complete
2. `PHASE1-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md` - Updated status and current sprint
3. `PHASE1-COMPLETION-CHECKLIST.md` - Marked process management tasks as complete
4. `IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md` - Updated Phase 1 progress visualization

### TODO Directory (`to-dos/`)
1. `MASTER_TODO.md` - Updated process management status and date
2. `PHASE1_TODO.md` - Updated process management to 100% complete
3. `ISSUES_TODO.md` - Updated last updated date

### mdBook Documentation (`docs/book/src/`)
1. `phases/phase1-microkernel.md` - Updated process management status
2. `project/roadmap.md` - Updated process management section to show completion

## Technical Achievements

### Completed in Process Management
- Full ThreadContext trait implementation for all architectures
- Context switching with FPU/SIMD state preservation
- Process system calls: `process_create()`, `process_exit()`, `process_wait()`, `process_exec()`, `process_fork()`, `process_kill()`
- Architecture-specific assembly for context switching
- Process synchronization primitives with priority inheritance
- Integration hooks for IPC and memory management

### Outstanding Work
- Scheduler implementation (required for full integration)
- Capability system implementation
- Full integration testing with all subsystems

## Next Steps

1. Begin scheduler implementation
2. Complete IPC-scheduler integration
3. Start capability system design and implementation
4. Continue with remaining Phase 1 objectives

## Summary

Process management is now fully implemented with all system calls and architecture support complete. This represents a significant milestone in Phase 1 development, bringing us closer to a functional microkernel. The project maintains high code quality with all builds passing and comprehensive documentation updated.
