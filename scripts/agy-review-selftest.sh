# agy-review-selftest.sh -- guards the comment-selection logic in `agy-review.sh`.
#
# Why this exists: that filter decides which existing comment the bot EDITS IN PLACE — the one
# whose body carries the archive of every prior review round. Pick the wrong one and a round is
# overwritten; pick none and the round is orphaned as a duplicate post. It has been wrong twice,
# both times invisibly.
#
# The two histories below are from the earlier design, which posted a fresh comment and deleted
# the previous one. That design is gone — nothing is deleted now — but the failures are recorded
# verbatim because they are what the fixtures are shaped to catch, and both remain reachable
# against an edit-in-place filter for the same underlying reasons.
#
#   1. The just-posted comment was not reliably excluded. `new_comment_id` came from re-querying
#      the comment list, which races GitHub's read replication; on a miss the exclusion became
#      `select(.id != null)`, true for every id, and the run deleted the review it had just
#      published.
#   2. jq's `--arg`/`--argjson` were handed to `gh api`, which has no such flags. It exited
#      non-zero, `2>/dev/null` hid the message, and `set -o pipefail` + `set -e` killed the script
#      AFTER posting — so stale comments silently accumulated and the job went red with nothing in
#      the log explaining why.
#
# Neither was catchable by looking at the review the bot posted: both times it posted fine. So the
# filter is tested here directly, offline, against fixtures — no network, no `gh`, no runner.
#
# Run: bash scripts/agy-review-selftest.sh
