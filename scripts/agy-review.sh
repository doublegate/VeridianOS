# agy-review.sh -- headless GitHub PR reviewer driven by Antigravity CLI (`agy`).
#
# Runs on a SELF-HOSTED GitHub Actions runner that lives on a machine where `agy`
# is already logged in via Google OAuth. Because it uses the CLI's cached OAuth
# session (not an API key), every review is billed against your Google AI Ultra
# rate limits -- i.e. free under the subscription, no metered API spend.
#
# Flow: resolve PR -> `gh pr diff` -> build an adversarial-reviewer prompt
#       (+ repo style guide) -> `agy --print` under a PTY -> post via `gh pr comment`.
#
# See README.md (installed into target repos as .github/AGY-REVIEWER.md) for setup, the issue #76
# PTY workaround, and the ToS caveat.

# Helpers are defined FIRST: the configuration block below calls log() from the MAX_PROMPT_BYTES

# `log: command not found` under set -e instead of warning — a latent misconfiguration trap.)

# A capture that is only a BACKEND ERROR, not a review. When agy's upstream is down it prints
# something like:
#
#   Error: Eligibility check failed: UNAVAILABLE (code 503): The service is currently unavailable.
#
# That text is non-empty, so have_text() alone treats it as a valid review, POSTs it as the
# review comment, and the job exits 0 -- a green check for a review that never happened. Observed
# on SLAC PR #14: the `review` check passed in 7 seconds with that string as its entire body,
# twice. A control that cannot fail is worse than no control.
#
# The match is deliberately ANCHORED to the start of the capture rather than being a substring
# search. A genuine review may legitimately quote a 503, an "UNAVAILABLE" constant, or an
# eligibility check while reviewing retry logic -- and aborting on that would be the
# false-positive the OAuth guard's design notes warn about. agy's backend failures occupy the
# WHOLE capture and begin with `Error:`, so requiring the error at the top, in a capture short
# enough to contain nothing else, separates the two without a content heuristic.
#
# Adopted FROM SLAC, which had it while the template and the other installs did not.

# `have_text` lives INSIDE this block, not above it: `backend_outage_should_fail` calls it, so

# changes nothing about where the function is defined.

#
# This was previously a list: Eligibility check failed | UNAVAILABLE | RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED |
# INTERNAL | DEADLINE_EXCEEDED | code 4xx/5xx. That list is unmaintainable by construction,
# and it failed exactly as you would expect. Observed on CyberChef-MCP PR #72, where agy posted
# this as its entire review and the `review` check went GREEN:
#
#     ## Antigravity review (Gemini via Ultra)
#
#     Error: timeout waiting for response
#
# A timeout is not in the list, so the guard let it through -- reproducing the precise failure
# the guard exists to prevent, one signature later. Enumerating failure modes only ever catches
# the ones already seen.
#
# Inverted: treat ANY leading `Error:` as a failure. The false-positive protection does not come
# from the message text at all, and never did -- it comes from the two conditions below, which
# are unchanged: the error must be on LINE 1, and the whole capture must be under
# AGY_ERROR_MAX_BYTES. The load-bearing half is the LINE 1 anchor: a review does not *open*
# with a bare "Error:" line, however short it is.
# Case-insensitive on the word itself: under `unbuffer` agy 1.2.x prints its eligibility failure
# as lowercase `error: Eligibility check failed: PERMISSION_DENIED (code 403) ...`, and the
# case-sensitive `Error:` let it through. Observed on VeridianOS PR #5: that line was posted as
# the entire review and the `review` check went green in 14 seconds.

# Guarding against a leak of agy's interactive Google OAuth login flow. When agy's cached
# session lapses on the runner, `--print` emits the login prompt (a live OAuth URL + "paste the
# authorization code here") instead of a review; that text is non-empty, so have_text() alone
# would treat it as a valid review and POST it — leaking the URL into a public PR comment (the
# incident this guards against).
#
# The guard keys on the ONE artifact that reliably distinguishes agy's login flow from any
# review: a live Google OAuth *authorization URL* (scheme + host + endpoint path). This choice
# is deliberate and is the convergence point of several rounds of agy's own adversarial review:
#   * It does NOT false-positive on reviewing the reviewer or on an OAuth-related PR. A code
#     review quotes this script's BARE regex ("accounts.google.com/o/oauth2", no scheme) or
#     discusses auth in prose; neither contains the "https://…/o/oauth2" URL form. (Earlier
#     signature/prompt-phrase heuristics wrongly flagged such reviews.)
#   * It needs NO "is this a review?" exemption, so it CANNOT be disarmed by a section header
#     (or the phrase "blocking issues") appearing in the same output as a URL — a false
#     NEGATIVE would be a leak. (Earlier "### Blocking issues" exemptions had exactly this hole,
#     and were also brittle to header case / trailing punctuation.)
# So this is both necessary (agy's login flow always prints the URL) and sufficient (nothing
# else legitimately carries a live authorization URL), with no heuristic that flips between
# false-positive and false-negative.
#
# The regex requires the scheme (`https?://`) and the host + `/o/oauth2` endpoint prefix, but
# deliberately NOT a trailing slash: agy round-4 flagged that a `.../o/oauth2/` requirement
# would miss a URL emitted as `.../o/oauth2?client_id=…` or bare `.../o/oauth2` (a leak). The
# scheme is what keeps a review's bare-pattern quote from matching, so dropping the trailing
# slash loses no safety.

# Validate and canonicalise a numeric setting that will reach an arithmetic expansion.
#
# @param $1 name of the variable to validate, assigned in place.
# @param $2 default to fall back to when the value is not a non-negative decimal integer.
#
# Two hazards, and the honest status of each is different -- so they are recorded separately
# rather than under one "unsafe input" heading.
#
#  1. Bash arithmetic recursively expands variable CONTENTS as a name, so `$(( V ))` with V=a and
#     a=5 yields 5, at any depth. Contents that are a command substitution are NOT executed on
#     bash 5.3 (measured here): they reach the parser as a literal and are refused with
#     "arithmetic syntax error: operand expected". This was reported in review as a CWE-78, and an
#     earlier version of this comment asserted the execution -- WRONGLY, from a nested-quoting
#     artefact in the test that ran it. It does not reproduce. What is left is still worth
#     refusing: a value naming another variable silently means something other than what it says.
#  2. Digits-only is not sufficient on its own. `09` is all digits, and bash reads the leading
#     zero as OCTAL:
#         $(( 1000000 * 09 / 1048576 ))   ->  value too great for base
#     So a *valid* setting takes the script down under `set -e`. That one is demonstrated, not
#     theoretical, and is the reason this function exists. Canonicalising to base 10 here, once,
#     means no downstream `$(( ))` has to remember `10#`.
# The locals are `_nne_`-prefixed because this function assigns THROUGH A NAME the caller supplies.
# Plain `name`/`val` locals shadow a caller variable of the same name, and the failure is silent --
# `normalise_numeric_env val 240` reads and writes the local, leaving the caller's `val` untouched.
# Verified: with unprefixed locals, `val=07; normalise_numeric_env val 240` leaves val as `07`.

# pre-filter plus `agy_has_write_access` above; see the trust model at the agy
# invocation below) is
# unchanged, and this only changes HOW an already-permitted diff is obtained when
# it is too large for the API. `refs/agy/*` are private namespaces (cannot clobber
# a real branch) and are removed on exit. Auth goes through `http.extraheader` for
