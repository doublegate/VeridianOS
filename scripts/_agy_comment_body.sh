#
# Sourced by `agy-review.sh` (which uses them) and by `agy-review-selftest.sh` (which tests
# them). It exists as a separate file for one reason: `agy-review.sh` does its work at TOP
# LEVEL, so it cannot be sourced without running a review, and a test that cannot call the
# real implementation ends up reimplementing it. That failure is not hypothetical here -- the
# first version of the archive test inlined its own copy of the `awk` pipeline, so a mutation
# deleting the marker strip from the script came back NOT CAUGHT. A test that reimplements its
# subject agrees with itself forever.

# Defines no state and runs nothing on source.

# The sentinels delimiting the archive of earlier review rounds inside the comment body.
#
# The reviewer used to POST a fresh comment each round and DELETE the previous one. That kept
# the PR tidy and destroyed the record: a round nobody read before the next push was gone, with
# nothing on the PR indicating it had existed -- and unlike a CodeRabbit or Copilot thread, an
# unaddressed finding left no trace. Observed on a real PR where two consecutive rounds each
# raised a blocking issue and only the second survived.
#
# Now there is ONE comment per PR, edited in place: newest round on top, earlier rounds folded
# into a collapsed `<details>` below. Same tidiness, no destruction.

# Marks where the archive SECTION begins -- i.e. the `<details>` wrapper, which sits OUTSIDE
# the start/end sentinels.
#
# Why a third sentinel rather than reusing AGY_ARCHIVE_START for both jobs: the two boundaries
# are not the same boundary. `agy_body_head` needs "where does the newest round stop", which is
# before the wrapper; `agy_body_archive` needs "where do the accumulated rounds begin", which is
# after it. Conflating them put the wrapper inside the extracted region, so every run captured
# the previous wrapper and nested a new one around it -- the archive grew a fresh `<details>`
# layer per round and `agy_drop_oldest_round` then tore holes in it. Measured on a real PR at
# round six: seven "Earlier review rounds" wrappers, 15 `<details>` against 13 `</details>`.
