# Phase 2 Status Summary - August 17, 2025

## Current Architecture Status

### AArch64
- **Boot Progress**: Reaches Stage 4 (Kernel Services)
- **VFS**: Initializes but reports already initialized (static contains garbage)
- **Driver Framework**: Hangs during static mut assignment
- **Key Issue**: Static mut assignments cause hangs
- **Fixes Applied**: 
  - Fixed inline assembly for memory barriers
  - Skipped VFS_STATIC = None assignment
  - Memory barriers properly wrapped in unsafe blocks

### RISC-V
- **Boot Progress**: Reaches Stage 6 but enters reboot loop
- **VFS**: Successfully initializes with direct static (no Box)
- **Thread Manager**: Bypassed to avoid reboot
- **Key Issue**: Static mut assignments cause reboots
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Replaced Box<RwLock<Vfs>> with direct RwLock<Vfs>
  - Skipped thread manager initialization
  - Added memory fences for atomic operations

### x86_64
- **Boot Progress**: Early boot hang
- **VFS**: Uses static mut with Box
- **Key Issue**: Very early boot hang, never reaches kernel_main
- **Status**: Needs investigation

## Key Discoveries

1. **Static mut Pattern Issue**: Both AArch64 and RISC-V have problems with static mut assignments, particularly when setting to None or Some(value)

2. **Box Allocation Issue**: RISC-V's bump allocator can't handle Box allocations properly, requiring direct static storage

3. **Memory Barriers**: AArch64 requires proper memory barriers for static mut operations, but even with barriers, assignments still hang

4. **Reboot Loop Pattern**: RISC-V enters reboot loops when static mut operations fail, while AArch64 hangs

## Fixes Implemented

1. **VFS Fixes**:
   - RISC-V: Use Option<RwLock<Vfs>> instead of Option<Box<RwLock<Vfs>>>
   - AArch64: Skip VFS_STATIC = None assignment
   - Both: Added proper memory barriers

2. **Thread Manager Fixes**:
   - RISC-V: Completely bypass initialization
   - AArch64: Still uses static mut pattern

3. **Driver Framework**:
   - Currently blocking AArch64 boot
   - Uses similar static mut pattern that needs fixing

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix AArch64 Driver Framework hang
2. **RISC-V**: Fix Stage 6 reboot loop 
3. **x86_64**: Debug early boot hang
4. **General**: Consider refactoring all static mut usage to avoid these issues

## Architecture-Specific Component Status

| Component | x86_64 | AArch64 | RISC-V |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------|
| Boot | ❌ Early hang | ✅ Stage 4 | ✅ Stage 6 (loops) |
| Memory Mgmt | ❓ Unknown | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |
| Process Mgmt | ❓ Unknown | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |
| VFS | ❓ Unknown | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Complete |
| IPC | ❓ Unknown | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |
| Scheduler | ❓ Unknown | ❓ Unknown | ⚠️ Reboot at Stage 5 |
| Drivers | ❓ Unknown | ❌ Hangs | ❓ Unknown |
| Services | ❓ Unknown | ⚠️ Partial | ⚠️ Partial |
| Thread API | ❓ Unknown | ❓ Unknown | ❌ Disabled |
| Shell | ❓ Unknown | ❓ Unknown | ❓ Unknown |

## Critical Pattern

The root cause appears to be architecture-specific handling of static mut variables, particularly:
- Writing to uninitialized or garbage-filled static memory
- Option<T> assignments in static mut context
- Box allocations with custom allocators (RISC-V bump allocator)

## Recommendation

Consider a major refactor to eliminate static mut usage in favor of:
- Once cells with lazy initialization
- Const initialization where possible
- Architecture-specific initialization patterns
