I want to create an operating system called 'Veridian OS', built entirely in Rust, focusing on security and performance. I aim to generate a detailed project description outline with technical details on the implementation of this project in various phases (including development, testing, and feature additions/enhancements in each phase). Also, describe what is needed in a hardware/software stack to initiate this. This document will serve as the foundation for this new operating system. Use the following as some initial guidance and thoughts (but feel free to improve upon them):

A new operating system built entirely in Rust, focusing on security and performance. We'll call it "Veridian OS," suggesting something fresh, green, and robust.

   (c) Research testing strategies for GUI responsiveness, window management, display driver compatibility, and overall user experience.
   (d) Explore potential feature additions or enhancements, such as advanced theming capabilities, accessibility features (e.g., screen reader support), and integration with existing Rust GUI libraries or frameworks.
(8) Research and summarize common development methodologies (e.g., Agile, iterative with milestones), community building strategies for open-source OS projects (e.g., forums, contribution workflows, governance models), and typical licensing options (e.g., MIT, GPLv3, Apache 2.0) suitable for Veridian OS, discussing their implications.
(9) Synthesize all the gathered information from steps (1) through (8) into a comprehensive project description outline for Veridian OS. This outline should clearly articulate the project's vision, the required initial hardware/software stack, and for each of the six development phases (Phase 1 to Phase 6), provide a detailed breakdown including:
   (a) Refined key features with specific technical implementation considerations.
   (b) A summary of development activities, challenges, and best practices.
   (c) An overview of robust testing strategies and quality assurance measures.
   (d) A list of potential feature additions, enhancements, and future research directions for each phase.
