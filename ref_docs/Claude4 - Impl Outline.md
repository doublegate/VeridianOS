- Mature Rust support with extensive community documentation
- Well-tested QEMU emulation for development
- Priority support for modern 64-bit processors

**Secondary Architecture: ARM (AArch64)**
- Target triple: `aarch64-unknown-none`
- Growing ecosystem support from projects like Redox and Tock
- Focus on ARM Cortex-A series for application processors

### Rust Toolchain Requirements

**Nightly Features Required:**
```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]
#![feature(asm)]
#![feature(lang_items)]
#![feature(alloc_error_handler)]
#![feature(custom_test_frameworks)]
```

**Essential Components:**

- Creates bootable disk images from ELF kernels
- Provides structured boot information
- Alternative: Limine for advanced multiprotocol scenarios

### Build System Architecture

**Cargo-based Configuration:**
```toml
[build]
target = "x86_64-unknown-none"

[target.x86_64-unknown-none]
runner = "qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel"

[unstable]
build-std = ["core", "alloc"]
```

**Build Tools:**
- `cargo-make` for complex build workflows

Following Redox OS's proven microkernel approach with enhanced security through Rust's type system. The kernel will be minimal, handling only:
- Memory management and virtual address spaces
- Process scheduling and context switching
- Inter-process communication (IPC)
- Basic hardware abstraction

### Memory Management Implementation

**Custom Allocator Design:**
- Kernel heap using `linked_list_allocator` initially
- Page-level allocation with buddy allocator
- NUMA-aware memory allocation for multi-socket systems
- Type-safe physical/virtual address distinction

**Page Table Management:**
```rust
use x86_64::structures::paging::{PageTable, Mapper, Size4KiB};

pub struct PageTableManager {
    mapper: OffsetPageTable<'static>,
    allocator: BootPhysMemoryAllocator,
}
```

### Process Management and IPC

**Process Architecture:**
