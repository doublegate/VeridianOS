**Current Status:** Phase 1 COMPLETE (v0.2.1 - June 17, 2025)
- Latest release: v0.2.1 - Maintenance Release
- All three architectures (x86_64, AArch64, RISC-V) boot to Stage 6
- Zero warnings and clippy-clean across all architectures
- Ready for Phase 2 User Space Foundation development

Looking at your linking error, this is a classic kernel memory model issue with R_X86_64_32S relocations. The problem is that your kernel is being linked at a high address (likely in the higher half of the virtual address space), but the code is trying to use 32-bit signed relocations which can only reach ±2GB from the current position.

Let me search for more specific information about this error and Rust kernel development.Based on the linking errors you're experiencing, this is a classic x86-64 kernel memory model issue. The R_X86_64_32S relocation can only handle signed 32-bit offsets (±2GB range), but your kernel is being linked at a high address that exceeds this range.

## The Problem

Your kernel is trying to use addresses like `-140737486798800` which is outside the valid range of `[-2147483648, 2147483647]` for R_X86_64_32S relocations. This happens when:

1. Your kernel is linked at a high virtual address (likely in the higher half)
2. The compiler is generating code that assumes symbols can be reached with 32-bit signed offsets
3. The precompiled `core` library wasn't built with the appropriate code model

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Use the Kernel Code Model (Recommended)

Most developers choose a kernel base address around -2GB (0xFFFFFFFF80000000) so kernel symbols can use R_X86_64_32S relocations. This is the most efficient approach.### Solution 2: Use the Large Code Model (For addresses beyond ±2GB)

If you need to place your kernel at an address beyond the kernel code model range (like `0xFFFF800000000000`), use the large code model:### Build Instructions### Troubleshooting Guide### Example Kernel Entry Point### Summary and Next Steps## Summary

The R_X86_64_32S relocation errors you're experiencing are due to your kernel being linked at a high address that exceeds the ±2GB range these relocations can handle. The problem is that the core library is distributed as a precompiled library that doesn't use the kernel code model.

### Recommended Solution: Use Kernel Code Model

1. **Update your target JSON** to use `"code-model": "kernel"`
2. **Configure Cargo** to rebuild the standard library with `build-std`
3. **Link your kernel at `0xFFFFFFFF80000000`** (top 2GB of virtual memory)
4. **Use the provided linker script** that properly handles the virtual/physical address split

This approach is used by Linux and most production kernels because it provides optimal performance while staying within the addressing limitations of x86_64.

### Key Commands

```bash
# Set up nightly Rust with rust-src
rustup override set nightly
rustup component add rust-src

# Build with the fixed configuration
cargo build --target targets/x86_64-veridian.json

# Create bootable image
cargo bootimage --target targets/x86_64-veridian.json
```

The artifacts I've created provide a complete solution including target configurations, build scripts, and example code. The kernel code model approach will resolve your linking errors while maintaining good performance.
