# Memory Bank Optimization Summary

## Optimizations Applied

### User Memory (/home/parobek/.claude/CLAUDE.md)
1. **Removed Project-Specific Content**:
   - Removed all Somnium project session summaries (lines 318-399)
   - Removed Sierra engine implementation summaries (lines 780-820)
   - These were project-specific and belonged in Local Memory

2. **Result**: Reduced from 820 lines to ~698 lines

### Project Memory (/var/home/parobek/Code/VeridianOS/CLAUDE.md)
1. **Removed Redundant Sections**:
   - Removed duplicate "Build Commands" section (lines 302-328)
   - Removed "Recent Session Work" section (lines 379-416)
   - Moved technical achievements to "Key Implementation Files" section

2. **Consolidated Content**:
   - Enhanced "Key Implementation Files" with specific technical solutions
   - Kept only developer guidance, not project state

3. **Result**: Reduced from 557 lines to ~496 lines

### Local Memory (/var/home/parobek/Code/VeridianOS/CLAUDE.local.md)
1. **Removed Duplicate Session Summaries**:
   - Consolidated 4 duplicate "Complete CI Resolution" summaries
   - Consolidated 3 duplicate "Critical Blockers RESOLVED" summaries
   - Consolidated 2 duplicate "AArch64 Boot Fix" summaries

2. **Reorganized Content**:
   - Created "Resolved Technical Issues" section consolidating all issues
   - Removed redundant "Resolved Issues" list
   - Created "Key Technical Achievements Summary" at end

3. **Improved Structure**:
   - Consolidated DEEP-RECOMMENDATIONS into single summary
   - Merged duplicate session content into concise summaries
   - Added clear technical achievement tracking

4. **Result**: Reduced from 985 lines to ~788 lines

## Key Principles Applied

1. **No Information Lost**: All unique information preserved
2. **Better Organization**: Related content grouped together
3. **Clear Separation**: 
   - User Memory: Generic patterns only
   - Project Memory: Developer guidance
   - Local Memory: Project state and progress
4. **Reduced Redundancy**: Duplicate content eliminated
5. **Improved Readability**: Cleaner structure, easier to navigate

## Overall Impact
- Total reduction: ~340 lines across all files
- Improved organization and clarity
- Maintained all critical information
- Better separation of concerns between memory banks
