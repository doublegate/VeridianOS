# Phase 1: Microkernel Core TODO

**Phase Duration**: 4-5 months  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS ~35% Overall - IPC ~45% Complete, Memory Management ~95% Complete, Process Management 100% Complete  
**Dependencies**: Phase 0 completion ✅  
**Start Date**: June 8, 2025  
**Current Focus**: Process Management Implementation  
**Last Updated**: June 10, 2025

🌟 **AI-Recommended Implementation Strategy**:
1. **Start with IPC** (Weeks 1-6) - Foundation for everything
2. **Thread Management** (Weeks 7-10) - Enables scheduling
3. **Memory Management** (Weeks 11-15) - Supports isolation
4. **Capability System** (Weeks 16-18) - Security layer
5. **System Calls** (Weeks 19-22) - User interface

**Performance Targets** (AI Consensus):
- Kernel size: < 15,000 lines of code
- IPC latency: < 5μs (aim for < 1μs later)
- Context switch: < 10μs
- Memory allocation: < 1μs
- Support: 1000+ concurrent processes
