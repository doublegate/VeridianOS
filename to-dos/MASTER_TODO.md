# VeridianOS Master TODO List

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-16 12:18 AM EDT (Phase 2 User Space Foundation COMPLETE!)

🌟 **AI Analysis Incorporated**: Technical roadmap enhanced with insights from Claude-4, GPT-4o, and Grok-3

This is the master tracking document for all VeridianOS development tasks across all phases and aspects of the project.

## 🎉 MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH (August 14, 2025)

### x86_64 Bootloader Resolution COMPLETE! 🚀
- **BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVEMENT**: x86_64 bootloader issues completely resolved!
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Two critical issues identified and fixed
  - Bootloader 0.11 BIOS compilation failure (downgraded to stable 0.9)
  - Missing heap initialization causing scheduler allocation failure
- **Technical Solution**: Systematic MCP tool analysis with specialized sub-agent
- **Result**: x86_64 now boots to Stage 6 with BOOTOK output!

### 🎯 COMPLETE Multi-Architecture Success! ✅
- **✅ x86_64**: **BREAKTHROUGH!** - Boots to Stage 6 with BOOTOK - **FULLY FUNCTIONAL!**
- **✅ AArch64**: Boots to Stage 6 with BOOTOK - fully functional
- **✅ RISC-V**: Boots to Stage 6 with BOOTOK - fully functional

### 🚀 Phase 2 Ready!
- **ALL ARCHITECTURES WORKING**: Complete multi-architecture parity achieved
- **CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE RESOLVED**: No more barriers to Phase 2 development
- **USER SPACE FOUNDATION**: Ready to begin Phase 2 with full architecture support

### Previous Achievement: v0.2.1 Released (June 17, 2025) 🎉
- **Boot Fixes**: All architectures successfully boot to Stage 6
- **AArch64 Fix**: Assembly-only workaround for LLVM loop compilation bug
- **Code Quality**: Zero warnings, clippy-clean across all platforms

### AArch64 Stack Fix & Implementation (Updated in v0.2.1) ✅
- **Root Cause**: Stack initialization issue, NOT LLVM bug - stack pointer was hardcoded instead of using linker symbols
- **Solution**: Fixed stack setup in boot.S with proper alignment and linker-defined addresses
- **Implementation**: Proper stack initialization, unified bootstrap, descriptive UART messages
- **Result**: AArch64 now boots successfully through Stage 6 with function calls working!
- **Remaining**: Bootstrap needs to transition to scheduler (see AARCH64-FIXES-TODO.md)

### Previous Critical Blockers (All Resolved June 15, 2025)
- **✅ ISSUE-0013 RESOLVED**: AArch64 iterator/loop bug - Created comprehensive workarounds + assembly-only approach
- **✅ ISSUE-0014 RESOLVED**: Context switching - Was already implemented, fixed scheduler integration
- **⚠️ ISSUE-0012**: x86_64 early boot hang (RESOLVED - no longer blocks Stage 6 completion)
