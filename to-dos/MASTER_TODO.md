# VeridianOS Master TODO List

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-15 (Phase 1 COMPLETE! Critical Architecture Issues Blocking Phase 2)

🌟 **AI Analysis Incorporated**: Technical roadmap enhanced with insights from Claude-4, GPT-4o, and Grok-3

This is the master tracking document for all VeridianOS development tasks across all phases and aspects of the project.

## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (June 15, 2025)

- **🔴 Missing Context Switching**: No architecture has working context switching implementation
- **🟡 x86_64 Boot Hang**: Still hangs very early despite bootstrap fixes (ISSUE-0012)
- **📋 Deferred Items**: 1,415+ lines organized into `docs/deferred/` with IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
