# Testing TODO

**Purpose**: Track all testing activities across the project lifecycle
**Last Updated**: February 20, 2026
**Phase 0-4.5 Status**: All complete. 29/29 boot tests passing on all 3 architectures.
**Host-Target Tests**: 646/646 passing via `cargo llvm-cov --lib --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`. Codecov integrated.
**Current Status**: Boot test suite operational (29/29). Host-target unit tests operational (646/646). Automated bare-metal test execution still blocked by Rust toolchain lang items limitation. Testing via QEMU boot verification is the primary validation method for kernel functionality.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy Overview
