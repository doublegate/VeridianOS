## Technical Achievements

### Code Quality
- **Build Status**: Zero compilation errors
- **Warnings**: Only 2 minor warnings (unreachable code, unused function)
- **Integration**: All components properly integrated into kernel
- **Architecture Support**: x86_64, AArch64, RISC-V

### Performance Metrics (from Phase 1)
- IPC Latency: < 1Î¼s achieved
- Context Switch: < 10Î¼s achieved
- Memory Allocation: < 1Î¼s achieved
- Capability Lookup: O(1) achieved

### Lines of Code
- Kernel: ~15,000 lines
- User-space components: ~3,000 lines
- Total: ~18,000 lines of Rust code

## Testing Status

### Boot Testing
- **x86_64**: Requires bootloader infrastructure
- **AArch64**: Boots to Stage 6 successfully âœ…
- **RISC-V**: Shows OpenSBI, kernel load pending

### Component Testing
- All components compile successfully
- Integration points verified
- Basic functionality implemented

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. x86_64 requires bootloader image creation for full boot
2. Dynamic linking not yet tested with actual shared libraries
3. Network drivers not yet implemented (deferred to later phase)
4. POSIX compatibility layer partial

### Resolved Issues
- ISSUE-0001 through ISSUE-0011: All resolved
- ISSUE-0012: x86_64 boot issues (workaround in place)
- ISSUE-0013: AArch64 LLVM bug (assembly workaround implemented)

## Next Steps: Phase 3 - Security Hardening

### Immediate Priorities
1. Secure boot implementation
2. Mandatory access control (MAC)
3. Capability system hardening
4. Encryption infrastructure
5. Security audit framework

### Future Phases
- Phase 4: Package Management System
- Phase 5: Performance Optimization
- Phase 6: GUI and Advanced Features
