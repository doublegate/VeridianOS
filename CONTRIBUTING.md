2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/VeridianOS.git
   cd VeridianOS
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/doublegate/VeridianOS.git
   ```
4. **Set up development environment** following [DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md)

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When creating a bug report, include:

- **Clear title and description**
- **Steps to reproduce**
- **Expected behavior**
- **Actual behavior**
- **System information** (OS, architecture, Rust version)
- **Relevant logs or error messages**

Use the bug report template when available.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, include:

- **Clear title and description**
- **Rationale** - Why would this be useful?
- **Detailed explanation** of the enhancement
- **Possible implementation** approach (if you have ideas)

### Code Contributions

#### First-Time Contributors

Look for issues labeled with:
- `good first issue` - Simple issues good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Issues where we need community help
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements

#### Areas Needing Contributions

- **Drivers**: Network, storage, and device drivers
- **Architecture Ports**: RISC-V support improvements
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, fuzzing
- **Documentation**: Tutorials, guides, API docs
- **Performance**: Optimizations and benchmarks
- **Security**: Security audits and hardening

### Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome! This includes:

- Fixing typos and grammar
- Clarifying existing documentation
- Adding examples
- Writing tutorials
- Translating documentation

## Development Process

### 1. Branch Strategy

- `main` - Stable branch, all tests passing
- `develop` - Development branch, PRs target here
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
- `fix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `docs/*` - Documentation branches

### 2. Setting Up Development Branch

```bash
# Sync with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout develop
git merge upstream/develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

### 3. Making Changes

1. **Write code** following our coding standards
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Update documentation** as needed
4. **Run tests locally**:
   ```bash
   just test
   ```
5. **Check formatting**:
   ```bash
   just fmt-check
   ```
6. **Run lints**:
   ```bash
   just clippy
   ```

### 4. Testing Requirements

- All new code must have tests
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Tests must pass on all supported architectures
- Include both positive and negative test cases

## Coding Standards

### Rust Style Guide

We follow the official [Rust Style Guide](https://github.com/rust-dev-tools/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/guide.md) with these additions:

#### Naming Conventions

- **Types**: `PascalCase`
- **Functions/Methods**: `snake_case`
- **Constants**: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Modules**: `snake_case`
- **Feature flags**: `kebab-case`

#### Documentation

Every public item must have documentation:

```rust
/// Allocates a physical memory frame.
/// 
/// # Returns
/// 
/// Returns `Some(Frame)` if successful, `None` if out of memory.
/// 
/// # Example
/// 
/// ```
/// let frame = allocator.allocate_frame()?;
/// ```
pub fn allocate_frame(&mut self) -> Option<Frame> {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### Error Handling

- Use `Result<T, Error>` for fallible operations
- Create specific error types using `thiserror`
- Provide helpful error messages
- Never use `.unwrap()` in non-test code

#### Unsafe Code

- Minimize unsafe code
- Document all safety requirements
- Isolate unsafe code in dedicated modules
- Provide safe wrappers

Example:
```rust
/// Dereferences a raw pointer.
/// 
/// # Safety
/// 
/// - `ptr` must be valid for reads
/// - `ptr` must be properly aligned
/// - The memory must not be mutated during access
unsafe fn read_raw(ptr: *const u8) -> u8 {
    // Safety: Caller ensures preconditions
    *ptr
}
```

### Architecture-Specific Code

- Place in `arch/<architecture>/` directories
- Use conditional compilation
- Provide common traits/interfaces
- Document architecture requirements

### Performance Considerations

- Profile before optimizing
- Document performance-critical code
- Prefer safe code unless performance requires unsafe
- Add benchmarks for performance-critical paths

## Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Test additions or modifications
- `build`: Build system changes
- `ci`: CI configuration changes
- `chore`: Other changes (e.g., dependency updates)

### Examples

```
feat(mm): implement huge page support

Add support for 2MB and 1GB huge pages in the memory manager.
This improves TLB efficiency for large allocations.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(scheduler): resolve race condition in thread wake

A race condition could occur when waking a thread that was
simultaneously being migrated to another CPU. This patch adds
proper locking to prevent the race.

Fixes #456
```

### Commit Best Practices

- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Write clear, descriptive messages
- Reference issues when applicable
- Sign commits with GPG when possible

export RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache

# Limit parallel jobs if low on RAM
cargo build -j 2

# Build only specific component
cargo build -p veridian-kernel
```

### Debugging

```bash
# Enable debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug just run

# Run with GDB
just gdb

# Use QEMU monitor
just run -- -monitor stdio
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench
```
