## Key Changes Summary

### Scheduler Implementation Progress
- âœ… Core scheduler structure with round-robin algorithm
- âœ… Idle task creation and management
- âœ… Timer setup for all architectures (10ms tick)
- âœ… Process/Thread to Task integration
- âœ… Basic SMP support with per-CPU data structures
- âœ… CPU affinity support in task scheduling
- âœ… Load balancing framework (basic implementation)

### Remaining Scheduler Work
- ðŸ”² Priority-based scheduling algorithm
- ðŸ”² CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) implementation
- ðŸ”² Real-time scheduling classes
- ðŸ”² Full task migration between CPUs
- ðŸ”² Performance measurement and optimization

### Process Management Adjustments
- Core functionality complete (PCB, threads, context switching, syscalls)
- Deferred items tracked:
  - Priority inheritance for mutexes
  - Signal handling subsystem
  - Process groups and sessions
- Adjusted percentage to 85% to reflect deferred items

### Documentation Improvements
- Added comprehensive scheduler documentation
- Updated all progress metrics consistently
- Created detailed deferred items tracking
- Improved performance baseline documentation with achievements
- Rebuilt mdBook documentation

## mdBook Rebuild
Successfully rebuilt the mdBook documentation with all updates:
```bash
cd /var/home/parobek/Code/VeridianOS/docs/book && mdbook build
```

All documentation is now synchronized with the current implementation status.
